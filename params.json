If you agree with what we've said, please [sign the statement](tinyurl.com/csiro-statement) and share it widely within your network._\r\n\r\n## The statement\r\n\r\nAs students and young researchers, the recent CSIRO cuts to climate science highlight a disconnect between the words and actions of national science policy. This disconnect has serious ramifications for Australia’s future prosperity.\r\n\r\nOur current political leaders emphasise the importance of advancing Australia’s capability in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) fields. But repeated funding cuts, chaotic restructuring of our key research organisations and the lack of a national strategy or a long­-term plan for scientific research in Australia suggest this is no more than lip service.\r\n\r\nWorking at the cutting edge of scientific research requires almost a decade of university education, funded by the taxpayer and at significant personal cost. In light of the instability of research careers in Australia, there is a growing expectation among students that to attain stable employment, we must move overseas.\r\n\r\nRather than building Australia’s scientific capacity after years of study we will be building the future capacity of other nations, while the cost of our training is borne here.\r\n\r\nFundamental scientific research is the foundation of transformative innovations, but a lack of job security and policy direction may give pause to any bright passionate kids considering a career in science.\r\n\r\nKey researchers who played an important part in the discovery of gravitational waves have been made redundant. World leading climate scientists are being let go and Australia’s own climate model is under threat. Half of Australia’s permanent climate research capacity will be gone as a result of the CSIRO cuts.\r\n\r\nWe cannot rebuild this capacity in an instant. It will take decades.\r\n\r\nIn light of what these recent events mean for Australia’s future science and innovation capacity we call on our political leaders to come together and forge a bipartisan, national, long­-term plan for scientific research in Australia. This plan must:\r\n\r\n- Provide a clear, stable career path for scientists within Australia and introduce a long­-term funding model for foundational research. Three­ year grants do not fulfil this need.\r\n- Recognise that taxpayer funded organisations like CSIRO cannot focus solely on profitable industry research at the expense of long term research for the public good.\r\n- Produce policy incentives to encourage business to undertake more industry-focused research and development.\r\n\r\nThis change needs to happen now before we further undermine Australia’s fundamental scientific capacity. As the people who will drive the scientific breakthroughs in the future, young researchers like ourselves call on the government to put forward a comprehensive plan for science research in Australia now.\r\n\r\n_Prepared by Arden Burrell, Mia Gross, Steefan Contractor, Mathew Lipson, Chiara Holgate (ANU) and James Goldie.
